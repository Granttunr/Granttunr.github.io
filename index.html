The job is on the furthest end of the occupational tree, often, as programmers are instructed as to what programs to make, and do not manage their own time. Instead, they manage the computer's time, and direct the computer in its tasks and methods of doing them. For this job, a BS in computer science is sufficient, but those interested in moving up may want more.","Web designers tend to focus primarily on their current client's needs and desires, custom desiging and programming for a very wide range of devices whilest being as tailored as neccessary. This job is very recent in its appearence in the world, yet already has a very large amount of firms and employees doing the work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the size of the market is projected to rise 27 percent in the next eight years, so positions will very likely be available.","Game designers, while likely not as strict or respectable as the above profesions, offer the world less practical pieces of software, but often more popular ones. Game designers spend their time designing, writing, programming, and testing games, focusing their talents toward more artistic goals. In terms of availability, the job is projected to rise, as it is considered an element of the set of profesions described as 'software engineer' by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This job typically requires a bachelors in computers of some sort, as often, other factors have bigger influences in the employment process."];

The concept revealed a fact later through further research- that surface tension arrises in substances other than liquids, such as solids. In terms of personal interpretation, the action looks similar to ricci flow in the second dimension.","Recently, Dr. Tao's submitted proof of the Erdos discrepancy problem was published. The problem was formulated in 1932 by the famous Paul Erdos and it concerned the summation of infinite +- 1 sequences. In essence, the problem seems obvious, but as demonstrated by history, it is significant in the complexity of assertions to required to express it absolutely. I cannot say I fully understand the depths of the problem, but the acceptance of a solution is of intruige.","Likely little description need be given of Mochizuki, concerning the huge applications of his recent work in IUT theory; however, it is adequate to say that if this proof of the abc conjecture is accepted, it would be of significance comparable to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Most assuredly, I cannot personally interpret this result in any meaningful way."];

                $scope.abit = ["Professor Feil-Seifer's presentation on his work is rather interesting concerning its implications and reasoning. Oftentimes, we consider not the best usage of our specializations from a deeply human perspective, instead focusing on what we offer ourselves for the future. Professor Feil-Seifer's research will likely not affect me as a reciever, but as a giver- as in, I would appreciate contributing to projects with philosophy like his. The reason is simple as that, too, because I think the effort has greater value if it is directed properly, as he is doing. In terms of solving issues in that area, I think that stronger forms of AI will help greatly... likely something beyond deeply complex neural networks. The current ability of the human is their ability to recognize failure and modify some exterior process to a proper or more optimal form, and while highly powerful neural networks can definitely get to this point, it seems to me like we could be able to implement something like that on a smaller scale.",
							   "One of the biggest inventions in the previous century was the airplane, not only because it generated large amounts of interest and money, but because it made the entire world significantly smaller in a few decades. The later years of the same century gave another significant invention- the automation of tasks on scales of ever-growing magnitude, and the combination of these two fields just as much potential as either of the two. It will likely affect me somewhat directly through the actions of Amazon because of the cheapness of the optomization. However, I find that, more generally, the world could be affected by his reaserch, as fires are significantly dangerous and searching through them puts more lives at risk. I think preparations could be made but shouldn't- we have to optimize what we have until the solutions he provides become widely available.",
							   "Relating to the previous professor, getting autonomous flying vehicles working in the general sense is distinctly vital to actually applying them. The exploration of the variations of drones and their best uses is therefore distinctly important, and the large-scale application of them is of additional relevance if cost is a target, which it usually is. For this reason, and the others discussed previously, this field will affect me directly with its removal of postal workers at first, and with further variations in time. Preparations, if I were to elaborate on the previous statements, would likely involve understanding and anticipating problems assosiated with drones, such as failures and accidents, especially in the legal sense. Airspace is, quite unfortunately yet properly, not free, so research stations should be set up (like the entire state of Nevada, for example).",
							   "Whilest a field that is still in its infancy, virtual reality has very great potential to change all of our perceptions on entertainment. For example, there has been a recent push among special effects enthusists to strive for distinctly realistic results, in order to increase impact and relevance. Virtual reality has this philosophy almost naturally, offering the direct placement into the world as a default feature. Unfortunately, running realistic virtual worlds is of a distinct challenge with our current computational abilities. Even more so, mobile processors have even less ability, but greater market share. This means that, if any 'silver bullets' exist, finding them will change the world. It is for this reason I have personal doubts (see Dr. Fred Brooks' paper), but cannot fully doubt humans in their ability to invent (see any Euler paper). This field will effect me somewhat soon, as I will likely purchase for my own usage a headset. I think that the issue here is in the delivery, though- we need stronger visuals and interaction. ",
							  "Assuredly, the value of large companies is generally much larger than we often expect, and upon the purchase of one, that value is exposed, along with all of the new potential and monetary resources in the purchaser. Recently, the giant which was once even larger, AT&T, purchased Time Warner for $85.4 billion dollars. This huge company once monopolized the telephone market and funded the development of UNIX and C, yet was broken up by the US Government in 1982. In terms of technology, AT&T now owns not only many methods of distributing entertainment, it also owns the entertainment itself. Horizontal integration is illegal, but vertical is not, and it seems like our markets are being collated into bigger and bigger collections of companies, specifically after the realization of the huge profitability of technological services. This will likely affect me in a non-obvious manner, as it tends to affect the long term, with the potential for impact from market failures increases when companies grow in size but total surplus stays the same. If this is an issue, a government job and a liberal vote would be good preparations.",
							  "As of late, the company SpaceX has suffered some drawbacks and problems with their rocket design, but is claiming that it is fixing the problems quickly and proceeding to launch again as quickly as possible. SpaceX has gotten on its feet relatively quickly and only on private funds, impressively already in the market of selling flights to governments. This is significant in its long-term applications, as the lower the price is to get a pound into orbit, the more quickly humanity will become space-fairing. In terms of preparation, perhaps overcoming my extreme fear of hights will help (although I doubt that my lifetime will contain events such as those mentioned above).",
							  "Earlier this year, the AI program AlphaGo defeated Lee Se-dol in the impressively complex game Go. This achievement is significant, but DeepMind, the company which wrote/produced AlphaGo, is aiming for an even higher goal- a video game called StarCraft. The challenge was huge, but now it is nearly impossible. The applications of AI in fields other than games are somewhat frightening but useful, but in games, it is often entertaining to find how inefficient humans are at the tasks we are the 'best' at. To see even video games, even strategy ones (ones oftentimes people give up on due to complexity)  be conquered by machines would continue to assert the relevance of artificial intelligence in the world- its ability to possibly replace humans in many areas. I haven't, with great unfortunance, a methodology of preparation concerning that fact that artificial intelligence may become more generally applicable than humans in general."];
